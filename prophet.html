    <h1>Load Forecasting with Prophet</h1>

    This tutorial is to predict the next 72-hour load for a single meter, which can run on my laptop. I will later show
    you how to execute this process on thousands or millions of meters using a distributed execution engine like Apache
    Spark. The code will not change much; rather, it is wrapped into a PySpark UDF. For now, let's stick to one
    meter
</div>
<div>
    The key to accurate load forecasting is not your coding ability or which&nbsp;language or framework you use. The key
    is
    your domain knowledge of the&nbsp;subject you are forecasting.&nbsp;/div>
    <div>The best thing you can do as a data scientist it to increase your domain knowledge by learning all you can
        about
        electricity usage, specifically the scenarios that affect load (human electricity usage patterns.)
    </div>
    <div>
        <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <li>What causes humans to consume more or less electricity?</li>
            <li>Which appliances use the most electricity, and when are they used?</li>
            <li>What is the effect of seasons on electricity usage?</li>
            <li>Can we correlate usage with hours of the day?&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Look at the min/max load for each hour, day, month, and year, and think about why it is the peak for the
                valley.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div>Answers to these questions should drive your approach to constructing the features for your model.</div>
    </div>
    <div>In the code below, I have a function for SuperBowl Sunday, which is a yearly American Football game that takes
        place in February.&nbsp; Many people change their habits that day and are at home or gathered together somewhere
        to
        watch the game.&nbsp; If you look at the data, you will see a difference in the usage data on that day.&nbsp;
        You
        might think that is irrelevant or that the playoffs should be added.&nbsp; That is where your creativity comes
        into
        play.&nbsp; Test if I'm wrong, and let me know. It may not affect and is a waste of time/CPU cycles.&nbsp; It's
        up
        to you.
    </div>

        <sub>This is an evolving tutorial, so more data and info will be added as we move forward</sub>


        <pre><h2>Imports</h2>
            <code>
import pandas as pd
from prophet import Prophet
from datetime import datetime
import numpy as np
import util
</code></pre>

<h2>Functions</h2>
<div>These seasonality functions will describe days as related or unrelated to other days.&nbsp; This is where
    we
    use our creativity, domain knowledge, etc. to create scenarios that would affect the forecast.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</div>
<pre>
<code>
Tell the model about SuperBowl Sunday

def nfl_sunday(ds):
date = pd.to_datetime(ds)
if date.weekday() == 6 and (date.month &gt; 8 or date.month &lt; 2):
    return 1
else:
    return 0
</code></pre>
<pre>
<code>
Tell the model about the school year. Students being at home vs. school changes electricity usage.

def school(ds):
date = pd.to_datetime(ds)
if date.weekday() and (date.month &gt; 7 or date.month &lt; 5):
return 1
else:
return 0
</code></pre>

<pre>
<code>
Tell the model about seasons. Summer and Winter spikes usage while Spring and Fall usage is much lower

def spring(ds):
    date = pd.to_datetime(ds)
    if date.month in (3, 4, 5):
        return 1
    else:
        return 0

def summer(ds):
    date = pd.to_datetime(ds)
    if date.month in (6, 7, 8):
        return 1
    else:
        return 0

def fall(ds):
    date = pd.to_datetime(ds)
    if date.month in (9, 10, 11):
        return 1
    else:
        return 0

def winter(ds):
    date = pd.to_datetime(ds)
    if date.month in (12, 1, 2):
        return 1
    else:
        return 0
</code></pre>

<h2>Data Setup</h2>
<pre>
<code>
# flat, linear, or logistic for growth
model_type = 'flat'

history: pd.DataFrame = util.get_voltage_data()
row_cnt: int = len(history.index)

# we want to leave the last 864 rows for testing the model
history = history.head(row_cnt - 864)

# adding functions to pandas dataframe
history['nfl_sunday'] = history['ds'].apply(nfl_sunday)
history['school'] = history['ds'].apply(school)
history['spring'] = history['ds'].apply(spring)
history['summer'] = history['ds'].apply(summer)
history['fall'] = history['ds'].apply(fall)
history['winter'] = history['ds'].apply(winter)
</code></pre>

<pre><h2>Model Setup</h2><code>
m = Prophet()
m.add_seasonality('nfl_sunday')
m.add_seasonality('school')
m.add_seasonality('spring')
m.add_seasonality('summer')
m.add_seasonality('fall')
m.add_seasonality('winter')
m.add_country_holidays(country_name='US')
</code></pre>
<pre>
<h2>Train the model</h2>
<code>
m.fit(history)
</code></pre>

<pre>
<h2>Create Future Dataframe</h2>
<code>
# we are working with 5 minute interval data which is 12 readings an hour
# and we need 72 hour forecast for a total of 864 readings
future = m.make_future_dataframe(periods=12*72, freq='5m', include_history=False)
future['nfl_sunday'] = future['ds'].apply(nfl_sunday)
future['school_in'] = future['ds'].apply(school_in)
future['spring'] = future['ds'].apply(spring)
future['summer'] = future['ds'].apply(summer)
future['fall'] = future['ds'].apply(fall)
future['winter'] = future['ds'].apply(winter)
</code>
</pre>
<pre>
<h2>Execute Model</h2>
<code> forecast = m.predict(future)[['ds', 'yhat', 'yhat_lower', 'yhat_upper']]
</code></pre>

        <pre>
<h2>View Results</h2>
<code>
pd.set_option('display.max_rows', None)
print(forecast.to_string())
</code></pre>
